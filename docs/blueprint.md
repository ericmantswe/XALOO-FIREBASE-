## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, slightly desaturated blue (#346691), for a corporate, professional feel. The choice of blue evokes the precision of engineering, as well as suggesting stability.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, modern backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#D97706), used to create visual contrast for CTAs and highlights. This will give an energetic note that still seems serious and not too distracting.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font to convey a modern and objective aesthetic suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clean and modern icons that reflect the services provided, focusing on automation, control systems, and industrial communication.
- Maintain a clear and structured layout to ensure ease of navigation. Use whitespace effectively to avoid a cluttered appearance.
- Incorporate subtle animations to enhance user engagement. Examples include fade-in effects, smooth scrolling, and animated transitions.
